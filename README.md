# Bikesharing_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal using data from NYC Citi Bikes.  The deliverables for this analysis are:
1. Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
2. Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
3. Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

## Results:
My final trip analysis story for Tableau can be found via this link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/natalie.legere/viz/shared/Z2DG5XFRH

In this Trip analysis story, below are the visualizations and description of the results:
1. A summary of the number of riders and customer types (combining 2 of the visualizations used during the module):

2. Citi Bikes were mostly used under an hour at a time:

3. Citi Bikes were used heavily during daylight hours:

4. Citi Bikes users were mostly male no matter the duration:

6. Male subscribers are the heaviest users of Citi Bikes:

## Summary
In summary, a bike-sharing program is successful when you have a solid base of subscribers.  In NYC, men who are subscribers made the most use of the bike-sharing program especially during daylight hours (7am to 9pm).  This is followed closely by female subscribers.

Additional visualizations I would perform with the given dataset would be:
1. Check if there is correlation between birth year and gender.  Since there is a higher proportion of men who use the bikes, we can also check if this is consistent for all age groups.
2. Check age vs start/end station.  The geography of where usage is higher may have to do with the population age group that lives/visits there.


Results: Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.
